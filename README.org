* dataflow-diagram-mode
This is an Emacs major mode for editing source files of [[https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/dataflow][dataflow]].

For Org Babel support, you can use [[https://github.com/akirak/ob-dataflow][ob-dataflow]].
** Configuration
The mode is not associated with any file extension by default, so I would recommend
adding one using =:mode= keyword in a =use-package= form:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package dataflow-diagram
    :mode "\\.dfd\\'")
#+end_src
